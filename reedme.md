High-Level Problem

The supermarket management wants to analyze and optimize the performance of its checkout system.
Currently, customers often experience long waiting times during busy hours, which leads to dissatisfaction and potential loss of sales.
The goal is to simulate and evaluate how different factors—such as the number of cashiers, customer arrival rate, and cashier service time—affect overall system performance (e.g., average waiting time, queue length, and total customers served).
