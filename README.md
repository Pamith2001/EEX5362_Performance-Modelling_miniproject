# Supermarket Checkout Simulation

##  High-Level Problem

The supermarket management wants to *analyze and optimize* the performance of its checkout system.  

Currently, customers often experience *long waiting times* during busy hours, which leads to *dissatisfaction* and potential *loss of sales*.  

The goal is to *simulate and evaluate* how different factors — such as the *number of cashiers, **customer arrival rate, and **cashier service time* — affect overall system performance (e.g., *average waiting time, **queue length, and **total customers served*).
